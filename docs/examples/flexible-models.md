# Transformations with Flexible Models

The code for the transformation below can be found here (`src/main/groovy/flexiblemodels` contains the definition of transformations and `src/test/groovy/flexiblemodels` how to execute them with some example models).

Flexible models allow for the transformation of semi-structured data, which combines structured elements (like tags) with unstructured components (like free text) without adhering to a fixed schema. This flexibility is beneficial in fields like big data and data integration, enabling the handling of diverse data sources without schema constraints.
