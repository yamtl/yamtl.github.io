# Flowchart to HTML

## Problem Description

In this worksheet, we will look at converting flowchart elements into HTML elements. The problem is open-ended, meaning, there is no one solution but rather the project will contain many small examples that showcase a multitude of operations for each documented MTL. The flowchart which should be used as the source model of the project is depicted in the diagram below:

<figure markdown style="height:350px;width:400px">
  ``` mermaid
  graph LR
    A[Begin] -->|Start| B[Wake up];
    B --> C{Is it really too early?};
    C --> |Yes| D[Sleep];
    C --> |No| E[Get up]
    D --> |Some Time Passes| B;
  ```
  <figcaption>Wakeup Flowchart</figcaption>
</figure>

Letâ€™s look at the required models for this transformation:

<figure markdown style="height:350px;width:400px">
  ``` mermaid
  graph BT
      B[Source Model] -->|conforms to| A[Flowchart Metamodel];
      C[MT Execution Engine] -->|reads| B;
      C -->|executes| D[MT Definition];
      C -->|writes| E[Target Model];
      D -->|uses| A;
      E -->|conforms to| F[HTML Metamodel];
      D -->|uses| F;
  ```
  <figcaption>Dependencies of the project files</figcaption>
</figure>

Now, let's see how the models are defined.

## Source Metamodel

The source metamodel is defined using Emfatic (.emf), which can be converted into an `ECore` file. You can then access the flowchart classes as `EPackage`s (`ECore` has `EClasses` which are referenced as `EPackage` in Groovy) to be used within the MT definition. Let's view the class diagram and code implementation (in Emfatic) of the source metamodel representing the Flowchart domain.

The full metamodel can be read in EMFatic notation [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamtl/examples/master/FlowchartToHTML_exercises/model/flowchart.emf).

## Target Metamodel

Just like before, the target metamodel is also defined using Emfatic. The metamodel script is long because all HTML elements must be defined so that the transformation generates a valid HTML document. Let's check out the class diagram and code implementation (in Emfatic) of the target metamodel representing the HTML domain.

### Class Diagram

The HTML metamodel is quite large to be viewed as one class diagram, so, let's see different sections of the metamodel for better understanding.

**HTML Section**

**HEADElement Section**

**BODYElement Section**

A lot of body related elements extend the BODYElement class. To show all of those elements the BODYElement section is further divided into 2 sub-sections with a diagram each.

*Sub-section 1:*

*Sub-section 2:*
![BODYElement Class Diagram 2](../assets/images/bodyelement-section2.png)

**TABLEElement Section**

**LISTElement Section**

**Other Classes**

## Fill-the-Gap Exercises

These examples allow learners to practice the use of the YAMTL language at different levels of complexity: 

* [Exercise 1](../exercises-problems/exercise1.md): creating an additional type of object in an output model within a rule.
* [Exercise 2](../exercises-problems/exercise2.md): specifying conditional application of rules.
* [Exercise 3](../exercises-problems/exercise3.md): practicing with rule inheritance.
* [Exercise 4](../exercises-problems/exercise4.md): defining several output elements in a rule to create a complex graph of objects in the output pattern.
* [Exercise 5](../exercises-problems/exercise5.md): using lazy and non-lazy rules.
* [Exercise 6](../exercises-problems/exercise6.md): using helpers.

To solve them go to the [YAMTL playground](https://yamtl.github.io/playground/?activities=https://yamtl.github.io/playground-activities/yamtl-demo-activity.yml).
