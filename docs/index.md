# YAMTL

Yet Another Model Transformation Language (YAMTL) is an expressive model-to-model transformation language that is offered as an internal domain-specific language (DSL) of JVM languages, including Java, Xtend, Groovy and Kotlin.

YAMTL is available as an IDE-agnostic Java dependency that augments the Java ecosystem with model analysis and model transformation capabilities that are not yet available in the latest version of Java. YAMTL transformations can be developed, debugged, and analyzed using the preferred Java IDE of choice and they can build upon existing Java dependencies to automate complex tasks. YAMTL operates on models defined with the Eclipse Modeling Framework.

YAMTL was found to be the fastest incremental model transformation tool, in general, for dealing with complex transformations between AADL models according to an independent industrial case study[^1].
